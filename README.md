## Topic

We don't know much about the front end, so this project we choose four front end development tools, AWT, Swing, JavaFx, SWT, to analysis their issues in developing project, hope we can have a general understanding of each tool's using condition, error points so that we can choose proper tools in different situation.

We statically compared the number of projects developed, the number of problems, and the amount of attention by accumulating and analysing data. At the same time we study the connection between  time change and problems arise dynamically contrast. Further more, in-depth analysis of samples of the issues appear highly in different tools with different states,  and search knowledge on line.
